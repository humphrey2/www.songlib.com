            <h5>While performing, your chords can automatically follow the leader.</h5>
            <p>Songlib lets one person be in control of the setlist.  When they change song, so does everybody who is "following the leader".  If the leader transposes the song, everybody else's songs transpose also.</p>

            <h5>Also controls the presenter</h5>
            <p>Yes, you heard right, the presenter is also updated if the controller changes song.</p>
