# Your private library

Each user has a private library, and is indicated by the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-lock" title="lock"></span> icon.  Use this library to store any songs that you don't want to share with your music team.  Songs can be *copied* between libraries, so a private library is the perfect place to put songs that you are considering for you music team, but aren't ready to share with them yet.

Private libraries cannot be shared with other users.  

# Shared libraries

Any library except for your private library can be shared with others.  Most of our users create a single shared library for their music team.  

## Inviting others

You can invite any number of users to join a library.  To invite somebody, enter their email address into the *members* tab of the library settings. You can specify whether each user has full-access or read-only access to the library.

They will be sent an email with a link that they can click to join your library.  They will need to sign up for a Songlib account first, if they do not have one.

You can revoke or change anybody's access at anytime.

# CCLI License

If you or your music team has a Christian Copyright Licensing International (CCLI) license number, it can be entered on your library settings page.  This helps you conform to licensing requirements by adding your license number to all presenter slides & generated PDF's.

There is also a report that shows you what songs songs where used when.

# Copying songs between libraries

Libraries are completely isolated from each other.  However, songs can be copied between them.  Once you copy a song into another library, they become independent songs, and can be edited separately.

To copy a song to another library:

1. Open that song in chord view
2. Click menu, then "Copy song to other library"
3. Select a library.

You'll be now looking at the song in the new library.

# Deleting a library

Any library (except for you private library) can be deleted by any user with full-access.  Be careful, deleting a library cannot be un-done by you.  However, a deleted library can possibly be restore by contacting support.
